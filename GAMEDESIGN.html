DESIGN THINKING - STAR MAP DELIVERY GAME
Created by Shakhzodbek and Jakhongir
==================================================

Step 1: Empathize
- Who is experiencing the problem?
  People who enjoy space games but want them to be quick and strategic.

- What are their needs and goals?
  They want to play short, brain-using games that are fun and challenging.

- What challenges or frustrations do they face?
  Long or boring games, confusing instructions, and lack of feedback.

- What emotions are involved?
  Excitement when planning, stress if it's too hard, and joy when winning.

- What would success look like from their perspective?
  Winning with the best route, getting stars, and enjoying a smooth experience.

User needs, feelings, frustrations, and observations:
- Needs: Simple UI, smart gameplay, fast feedback
- Feelings: Fun, excited, curious
- Frustrations: Repeating levels, unclear progress
- Observations: Players love strategy with reward systems

--------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Define
Problem Statement:
"Strategy game players need a fun and fast way to plan space routes because they enjoy brain challenges without wasting too much time."

--------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Ideate
Possible ideas:
- Add route planning with drag-and-drop
- Show energy cost in real time
- Use star ratings based on how efficient the route is
- Make the ship fly with smooth animation
- Add themes: space, robot world, magic galaxy
- Bonus stars for secret planets
- Add a leaderboard for friends

Creative twist:
- Secret system appears only when the best route is chosen

--------------------------------------------------

Step 4: Prototype
Prototype description:
- A simple map with 6 star systems
- Player taps systems to build a path
- Route line and energy cost show up
- They can rearrange systems before starting
- After pressing "Go", ship flies on the screen
- Player sees final score and rating

Key interactions:
1. Click systems → route builds
2. Rearrange → plan better
3. Hit Go → animation + result

--------------------------------------------------

Step 5: Test
Feedback Collection:
- What did players like?
  The energy counter and space visuals.

- What questions did they have?
  Can we undo a system? Can we replay easily?

- What would they improve?
  Add levels, sound effects, and hidden stars.

Final changes based on test:
- Add undo button
- Include background music
- Different difficulty maps
