Maze Escape: The Maze Challenge

Game Overview:
Maze Escape is an exciting puzzle game where players must navigate through a maze to reach the exit.
The game provides multiple levels of increasing difficulty, making it more engaging as the player progresses.

Objective:
- The objective is to find the exit in the shortest possible time.
- Move the player using arrow keys to avoid obstacles and reach the exit point.

Game Mechanics:
1. Maze Layout: Each level consists of a grid-based maze with walls (1) and open paths (0).
2. Movement: Players use arrow keys to move the player icon through the maze.
3. Goal: Reach the exit point marked in green.
4. Victory Condition: If the player reaches the goal, they win the level and can proceed to the next one.
5. Level Progression: The player starts with easy levels and faces increasingly complex mazes as they advance.
6. Restart Feature: Players can restart the current level at any time.

Design Thinking Process:
1. Empathize: We researched puzzle and maze games to understand how to make it engaging.
2. Define: The challenge was to create a maze game with progressively harder levels and simple controls.
3. Ideate: The game allows the user to move through the maze and navigate obstacles, while being intuitive and user-friendly.
4. Prototype: The web-based prototype was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow easy interactions.
5. Test: The game was tested to ensure that the levels became progressively harder and the player controls were smooth.

How to Play:
- Use the arrow keys to move the player through the maze.
- Avoid the walls and try to reach the green exit square.
- The game has multiple levels, and you can proceed to the next level after successfully completing the current one.
- If you win a level, click the ‚ÄúNext Level‚Äù button to move on.
- You can also restart a level at any time by clicking "Restart Level".

Technologies Used:
- HTML: For the basic game layout and structure.
- CSS: To style the game elements and provide an attractive interface.
- JavaScript: For interactivity, handling player movement, level progression, and maze generation.

Conclusion:
Maze Escape provides an entertaining way to challenge puzzle-solving skills while offering a fun and interactive experience. The game progresses through various levels, encouraging players to think strategically and plan their moves.
